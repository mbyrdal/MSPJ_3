This project is about a system for car scrapping dealership, where a client can get connected to a web-server with

For software testing we're using the xUnit framework. We plan on using unit testing-, intergration-, and acceptance testing.
Beside that are we also going to do performance testing. All composite methods and classes should be tested. 
Test should be able to happen on multiple PC's at the same time. There is also a plan for automated testing.

The coding style we're using in this project is CamelCase, English names and no abbriviations. 
For commentary for bigger functions we use XML syntax. 
For additions in testing we use underscores _ example Test_ThisSpecificMethod.
We use DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principles so that we can aim for our project to have the best quality 
and we reach the goal of having low coupling, high coheasen.
